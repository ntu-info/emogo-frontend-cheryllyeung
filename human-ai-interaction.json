      "user": "What emotions should I include?",

      "id": 3,
      "user": "Should I add intensity levels?",
      "ai": "Yes, adding a 1-10 intensity scale will make the tracking more detailed and useful for users to express the strength of their emotions.",

      "id": 4,

      "user": "How do I display the saved emotions?",
      "ai": "Let's create a scrollable list showing emotion cards with timestamps, plus a statistics section showing total records and most common emotion. I'll also add export and clear data buttons.",

      "id": 6,
      "user": "What should the data format be?",
